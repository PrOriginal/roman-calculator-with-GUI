# roman-calculator-with-GUI
- Takes Roman numerals as a input and performs mathematical calculations with it. 
- Provides output both in Roman and Arabic numbers.
- GUI was made using tkinter Python package.

Was made for learning purposes. In particular to improve OOP skills. And just because I really liked the idea.
