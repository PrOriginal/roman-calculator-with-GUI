# roman-calculator-with-GUI

Was made for learning purposes. In particular to improve OOP skills. And just because I really liked the idea.
-Takes Roman numerals as a input and performs mathematical calculations
with it. Provides output both in Roman and Arabic numbers.
-GUI was made using tkinter Python package.
